    "\n",
    "[md2canvas](https://github.com/eoas-ubc/md2canvas) is a command that can be used to convert your Jupyter Notebook quizzes (in markdown or notebook format) directly to Canvas quizzes, which can then be automatically pushed to your Canvas course. It also has the ability to strip the answers from your quiz so that it is distributable to students and the public.\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation is [here](https://maracieco.github.io/md2canvas/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "md2canvas is currently under development with the main tasks being adding automatic testing using pytest and GitHub Actions (functional but limited), printing the quizzes without answers to paginated PDF using Sphinx (not started), and parameterizing the quizzes so that multiple versions can be generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are currently looking for alpha testers! If you see this as being useful for your work in any way, please try it out and give us any feedback you have. We are open to suggestions and constructive criticism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Basic Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install the package:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    pip install git+https://github.com/maracieco/md2canvas\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Send a quiz to your canvas course:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    md2canvas examples/demo_quiz/DemoQuiz.md -f path/to/token.txt -c 51824 -u https://canvas.ubc.ca -s\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    -f provides the path to a file containing your authentication token\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -c provides the course ID\n",
    "\n",
    "    -u provides the Canvas URL\n",
    "\n",
    "    -s tells the program to save these three settings in a config file so they aren't required in the future\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note: this command won't actually work, you will need to generate your own token and use your own course ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Strip the answers from your quiz so it can be distributed to students:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",

    "\n",
    "1. md2canvas uses the cells and their metadata to parse the questions with their answers and send them to Canvas\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Here is a simple example question in its pure markdown form:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    +++ {\"ctype\": \"question\", \"quesnum\": 1, \"question_type\": \"multiple_answers_question\"}\n",

    "    ### Question 1\n",
    "    Choose the odd numbers.\n",

    "    * 1\n",
    "    * 2\n",

    "    +++ {\"ctype\": \"answer\", \"quesnum\": 1}\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is a multiple answers question. On Canvas, it shows up with square boxes beside the answers and allows the quiz taker to select multiple answers. The truth values of the different answers match up one to one. A similar type of question is the multiple *choice* question, which only allows one answer to be chosen and has circles beside the answers on Canvas.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    And here is a screenshot of it in a Jupyter Notebook:\n",

The first one will be parsed for answer data and must follow specific formatting. The following cells can be anything, so they can be used as descriptions of the answers or code cells for computation or anything really. All of these cells will be stripped by anstrip as long as they are tagged as answer cells in the metadata.\n",
    "\n",

Because of this, the first value in the answer key is 5. Note also that there are some extra answers in the right list which act as distractors and do not have a pairing.
